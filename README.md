Pre-Project Thoughts
Having only produced an android logo previous to this project, I wasn’t expecting much. Although the google home page looks simple, after inspecting the underlying code, I knew I was up for a challenge. 
Post-Project Thoughts
The page looks reasonably similar. I found the search bar to be difficult to display to a similar level. One of my major challenges was moving elements on the page. The different properties and selector format was an issue. The difference between display properties such as inline or inline-block will have to be researched further.
